# Overview 

This assignment involved fitting and evaluating a multiple linear regrsesion model to explore how price, clothing line, and season of release affected the quantity of items sold.

**Tools**:  R (tidyverse, ggplot2)

## Key tasks:

* Fit a linear regression model
* Perform ANOVA to test significance of model terms
* Check model assumptions using diagnostic plots
* Interpret regression coefficients and confidence intervals
* Visualise the relationship between price/line/season and quantity sold.

## Takeaways:

* Price increases associated with lower sales quantities
* Clothing lines performed differently across seasons
* Interaction effects between clothing line and season were statistically significant
